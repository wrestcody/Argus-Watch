# Argus-Watch
Intelligent, risk-assessed compliance monitoring for the cloud.

## üåü Overview
Argus-Watch, named after the hundred-eyed giant of myth, provides comprehensive, all-seeing monitoring of cloud environments. Its core mission is to transform noisy, low-context compliance alerts into intelligent, risk-assessed signals that allow security and GRC teams to focus on what truly matters. It achieves this by combining scalable, native-cloud monitoring with a low-code automation workflow powered by an LLM for enrichment and risk assessment.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* **Scalable Multi-Account AWS Monitoring:** Natively integrates with AWS services like AWS Config and Amazon EventBridge to monitor resources across your entire organization.
* **AI-Powered Risk Assessment:** Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to enrich compliance findings with business context, assess potential impact, and assign a dynamic risk score.
* **Intelligent Alert Tuning:** Drastically reduces alert fatigue by suppressing low-risk findings and escalating only what's critical, based on a procedural risk framework.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** Enables security analysts to validate, correct, or escalate findings, creating a feedback loop that continuously refines the AI's accuracy.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The system operates on an event-driven data flow. It begins when an AWS service like AWS Config or Amazon EventBridge detects a resource change or executes a scheduled check. This event triggers a compliance-checking AWS Lambda function, which assesses the resource against a specific rule. If a misconfiguration is found, a detailed finding is published to an SNS topic. An automation platform (like N8N or Tines) subscribes to this topic, receives the finding, and orchestrates a workflow. This workflow queries an LLM, providing it with the finding details and a procedural risk assessment document. The LLM evaluates the risk and returns an enriched, scored alert, which is then routed to a destination like Slack or Jira for human review and action.
